This is a project for learning ReactJS. It's a simple counter app that increments, deletes and resets multiple counters. While simple, it covers quite a lot of important react fundamentals such as handling state and props, and how a ReactJS program should be layed out.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
